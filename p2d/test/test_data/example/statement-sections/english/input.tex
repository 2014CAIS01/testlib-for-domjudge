The first line contains a single integer $n(0 \leq n \leq 200)$, denoting the number of boxes in the warehouse.

Next $n$ lines, each line $8$ integers, $x_{i_0},y_{i_0},x_{i_1},y_{i_1},x_{i_2},y_{i_2},x_{i_3}, y_{i_3}$, arranged in a counterclockwise direction, representing a rectangular box.

The $n + 2$ line contains $4$ integers $x_0, y_0, x_1, y_1$, respectively representing the coordinates of Hsueh- and the coordinates of the manual.

The absolute value of all integers does not exceed $10000$.

Test data to ensure that the vertices of two boxes will not overlap, and at the same time ensure that the vertices of one box will not appear on the edge of the other box.
