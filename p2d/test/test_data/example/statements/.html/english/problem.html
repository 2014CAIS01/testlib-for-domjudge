He could only call the master, but the master also forgot how to operate.</P><P>Finally, the master told him that the manual had been thrown in a certain position in the warehouse and told him the coordinates. Now Hsueh- can finally find a way to restart the server!</P><P>When Hsueh- walked into the warehouse, he found that due to the random stacking before, the whole warehouse was very chaotic. Even if he knew the coordinates, he needed to go over some boxes.</P><P>Because the boxes are randomly placed, they will not overlap.</P><P>For instance, the warehouse might look like the picture below. It can be considered that the warehouse is infinitely large, and Hsueh- is infinitely small, which can be regarded as a point.</P><P><CENTER> <IMG class="tex-graphics" height="378px" src="79b0b25efc80c25bcecceed02dcc238b6c483846.png" width="302px"> </CENTER></P><P>Since the box was moved around all day, plus a lot of roads, he finally didn't want to climb over, so he decided to bypass the box. At the same time, he hopes to take the shortest path.</P><P>However, he wants you to tell him the shortest path length, so that he can decide whether to restart the server or replace it with a Pangalactic Universe Invincible Infinite Co., Ltd.
