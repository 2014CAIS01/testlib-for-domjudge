He could only call the master, but the master also forgot how to operate.\n\nFinally, the master told him that the manual had been thrown in a certain position in the warehouse and told him the coordinates. Now Hsueh- can finally find a way to restart the server!\n\nWhen Hsueh- walked into the warehouse, he found that due to the random stacking before, the whole warehouse was very chaotic. Even if he knew the coordinates, he needed to go over some boxes.\n\nBecause the boxes are randomly placed, they will not overlap.\n\nFor instance, the warehouse might look like the picture below. It can be considered that the warehouse is infinitely large, and Hsueh- is infinitely small, which can be regarded as a point.\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=8cm,height=10cm,natwidth=320,natheight=360]{data1.png} % 插入图片\n\\end{center}\n\n\nSince the box was moved around all day, plus a lot of roads, he finally didn't want to climb over, so he decided to bypass the box. At the same time, he hopes to take the shortest path.\n\nHowever, he wants you to tell him the shortest path length, so that he can decide whether to restart the server or replace it with a Pangalactic Universe Invincible Infinite Co., Ltd. Super Advanced Unspeakable Fairy Server.\n\n","authorLogin":"Dup4","language":"english","timeLimit":5000,"output":"Print a single float number, denoting your answer.\n\nYour answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed $10^{-4}$.\n\n\nFormally, let your answer be $a$, and the jury's answer be $b$.
